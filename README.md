# Stratosphere Assessment

 I sort of split up the web page into three different components, Top, Middle and Bottom.
 The App.js file just contains 3 components, and these components can be found under the src/components directory.
 Each comonent has a CSS module associated with it which contains all the CSS styling for that specific component.
 
 Unfortunately I am short on time, otherwise I would have tried to refactor BottomComponent using CSS grid. I think that would have made the styling more robust for different screen sizing. For now, I have utilized mutliple media queries to make the BottomComponent responsive.

### Running the App

git clone --> npm install in directory -->  npm start

My node version: v16.13.0
My npm version: 8.1.3
